## Prerequisites

1. Install [Python 3.11+](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) if it‚Äôs not already installed

### For Building a Website with Hugo (Optional)

1. Create a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website such as by using the [Hugo Academic Starter](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic) template for the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com) website builder
1. [Download your site from GitHub, installing Hugo and its dependencies](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/)
1. [Version control](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#version-control) your website
   - Ideally, version control your site with [Git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) so that you can review the proposed changes and accept or reject them without risking breaking your site
   - Otherwise, if not using Git, **backup your site folder** prior to running this tool

## Installation

Open your Terminal or Command Prompt app and install the Academic CLI tool:

    pip3 install -U academic
    
Or, help test the latest development version:

    pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-academic-cli.git

## Usage

Download references from your reference manager, such as Zotero, in the Bibtex format.

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing your Bibtex file:

    cd <MY_BIBTEX_FOLDER>

**Import publications:**

Say we downloaded our publications from our reference manager, such as Zotero, to a file named `my_publications.bib` within the website folder. We can import them into the default `content/publication/` folder with:

    academic import --bibtex my_publications.bib

**Import publications to a specific folder (e.g. `content/zh/publication`):**

Say our site has multiple languages, we may want to output the publications to a specific folder with:

    academic import --bibtex my_publications.bib --publication-dir content/zh/publication/

Optional arguments:

* `--publication-dir PUBLICATION_DIR` Folder to import publications to (defaults to `content/publication`)
* `--overwrite` Overwrite any existing publications in the output folder
* `--normalize` Normalize tags by converting them to lowercase and capitalizing the first letter (e.g. "sciEnCE" -> "Science")
* `--featured` Flag these publications as *featured* (to appear in *Featured Publications* widget)
* `--verbose` or `-v` Show verbose messages
* `--help` Help

After importing publications, [a full text PDF and image can be associated with each item and further details added via extra parameters](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/publications/).
